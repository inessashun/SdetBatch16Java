The super() keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class from
 within the constructor of the child class. It must be the first statement in
  the constructor of the child class. By calling the parent class constructor
   using super(), the child class can inherit the properties and methods of
   the parent class and add its own properties and methods as needed.
